# crud-firebase-app
A little CRUD app for storing info about games you've played.
The games are stored in Firebase's Firestore database.
It includes a login/registration form with full validation and a Google sign up method. User auth is handled by Firebase.
The registration form and the modal for adding, updating and deleting games are handled and validated using React Hook Form and the Yup library.
There's a search functionality that dynamically displays games that match the search term.
I've also added drag and drop functionality between the two tables of games using the react-beautiful-dnd library.
